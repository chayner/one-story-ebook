__God creates the universe and presents His eternal plan. Sin enters the world.__

The Bible contains some amazing true stories; however, it is not simply a story book. The Bible is God's written revelation of His will to humanity. When you read the Bible, read with eagerness and persistence seeking to grow closer to God and better understand His purpose for your life.

When God created, He made something from nothing. He created us. Therefore, we have no reason for pride. We exist because He created us.
