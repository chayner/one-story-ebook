__Job shows patience during suffering. Abraham demonstrates faith and receives promises from God.__

When good people suffer bad things, they sometimes never learn the real reason. Job doesn't explain why bad things happen but does explain how to deal with them biblically.

Notice how faith affects Abraham's behavior. In your own words, write a definition of faith.
