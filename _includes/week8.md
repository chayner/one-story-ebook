__Moses gives excuses for not serving as God asks. God uses miracles and plagues to show who He is to both Egyptians and Israelites.__

Moses spent his first 40 years living in luxury in Egypt. After fleeing Egypt, he spent his next 40 years serving as a shepherd until God called him.

Notice how the pillar of the cloud moved from in front of the Israelites to behind them as they prepared to cross the Red Sea. It separated the Israelites and Egyptians. The pillar gave light to the Israelites while giving darkness to the Egyptians.
