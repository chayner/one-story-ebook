__Moses sings to praise God. Manna pictures the Word of God. Moses learns he needs others to help him.__

Think about what you would put into a song about God. Moses sang about what God did, His power, His majesty, His mercy, and His promises. Is God your strength and song as He was for Moses?

It doesn't take much to stop praising and start complaining when we don't understand what God is doing. Do you look at God's Word and ask, “What is it?” or do you recognize it as your source of strength? As a believer, do you behave as a holy priest?
