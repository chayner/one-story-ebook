__Melchizedek pictures Christ as High Priest. Physical circumcision pictures spiritual circumcision.__

Notice what happens when Abraham and Sarah take a detour rather than waiting for God to fulfill His promises, in His way, in His own time. Keep a note of this for those times when you are tempted to rely on your own wisdom.

When we trust Christ to save us and agree that He is our Lord, the Holy Spirit performs a spiritual circumcision on us.
